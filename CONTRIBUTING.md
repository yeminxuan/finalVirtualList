# How To Contribute

## Opening issues

- Before opening issue please search for the keyword see whether the issue you encountered has been reported already. :pray:

- Issues should be opened with the corresponding template, fill in the form to provide sufficient information to reproduce the issue, so that our developers can help you verify and fix it

**Insufficient information issue WILL BE CLOSED directly because we cannot reproduce them**


## Commit template

We prepared a commit message template for you to refer to, you can also follow the instruction of the CLI tool to generate
commit message intuitively.

1. With command

```bash
yarn cz
```

2. You can also write the commit message by hand, but make sure your
   commit message follows the rules.

NOTE:
**PRs with unformatted commit message WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED**

That's all, thanks for your contribution! ðŸ¤©
